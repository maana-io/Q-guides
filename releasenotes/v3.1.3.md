# v3.1.3

## New Features and Capabilities

### Platform Backup and Restore

See deployment instructions

### Migration path from v3.1.2 to v3.1.3

Now as a part of platform updates, existing data can be preserved, with the migration done after installation.  To perform the migration, mutation **must** be run on maana-admin service.  The same approach will be followed in the following releases.  For more details see deployment instructions.

### Major Performance Improvements for CKG-Based Services

CKG Queries that use joins now perform \(at minimum\) an order of magnitude faster. For instance, query below would execute only 2 queries instead of N+1 where N is number of Person kind instances.

### Improvements to the Context Panel: Info Tab

The Workspace Context Panel has been streamlined - the Info Tab has had redundant information about graph nodes and non-functional controls removed.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

The ability to page the results of a kind or allInstance query has been added.

Notes:

* Token will be returned as null when the data is exhausted
* This does not work currently with QueryJSON

## Fixed Issues

| **Fixes and Improvements** |

| ENG-14622  Fixed, now handles ISO time format for data uploads. |
| ENG-14616  Fixed, CLI now handles uploads for data with fields of type Date and DateTime. |
| ENG-14603  Fixed issue where CLI was unable to autogenerate mutations from certain schema files. |
| ENG-14357  CLI documentation updated: [https://github.com/maana-io/Q-tutorials/blob/master/cli/README.md](https://github.com/maana-io/Q-tutorials/blob/master/cli/README.md)â€‹. |
| **Other Fixes** |
| ENG-14623  Fixed issue around mis-handling of multiple workspaces named "Untitled". |
| ENG-14610  Fixed issue where maana-azure-crawler service returned an error message even after it appears to fire off crawling okay. |
| ENG-14543  Fixed issue where second system bootstrap attempt was previously impossible, as attempt to create system tables failed. With new error handling it proceeds after number of retries. |
| ENG-14558  Empty hasKind instances are no longer displayed in the relations tab in the context panel. |
| ENG-14525  Fixed issue addressing unexpected, unrecoverable workspace crash. |

| ENG-14504  Fixed issue around failure of Entity Extraction service not being handled on client side. |
| ENG-14497  User can now edit a non-name field of a kind without resulting in this error: "kind with the given name already exists". |
| ENG-14493  Fixed issue that prevented the links to PhysicalQuantity from appearing in the UI as links on the source Kind. |
| ENG-14490  Fixed issue around multiple filters being retained in the Query Graph upon browser refresh despite having removed one or more filters. |
| ENG-14485  The "Next" button in the preview panel is now visible even if Kind has more than 12 fields. |
| ENG-14484  UI canvas can now handle cases where a workspace with an instance \(e.g. File\) is linked from an instance to a kind \(i.e. "toInstance" is null\). |
| ENG-14400  Fixed unexpected error message that occurred when user clicks on their workspace as a service in the inventory. |
| ENG-14387  _createdOn_ and _lastOpenedOn_ fields pertaining to a Workspace, in the info tab of the context panel are no longer editable. |
| ENG-14385  Fixed issue around Knowledge Graph name disappearing from UI. |

        <p>When large amounts of text data are added through the UI, the platform
          will become unresponsive. This is the result of the entity extractor bot
          performing a large number of writes to record the links to entities that
          it has found in the text. To prevent this, it is necessary to disable the
          entity extractor bot either by removing its instances,</p>
