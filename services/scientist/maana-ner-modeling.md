## Maana NER Modeling service

This is the maana NER (Named Entity Recognition) Modeling graphql microservice.
It provides:

1.  Extract entities (Person name, Location, Phone number, ...) from text.
2.  Training new CRF (Conditional Random Field) Classifier Model. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field
3.  Testing CRF Model.
4.  Auto-annotation of text.

Maana-NER-Modeling detects entities in text data using two approaches:

- Stochastic method - Stanford CRF Classifier (Conditional Random Field: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field) and
- Deterministic method - Tokens Regex: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/tokensregex.html

## Detected Entities with default (Stanford) CRF Model:

| n   | Entity               | CRF | Regex |
| --- | -------------------- | --- | ----- |
| 01  | DateKind             | +   | +     |

## Formats of train/test data

dataURL (in training / testing queries) is a path or URL to data file of many formats: .json, .csv, .tsv, .txt

1.  Phrase array .json
    Each entity can be defined one of combination:

- {tag, token} - entities in this format must to be ordered in according of their appearance in the text
- {tag, span, offset} - this is character-based format and entities may not be ordered
- {tag, tokens} - this is word-based format and entities must to be ordered
- {tag, start, end} - this is word-based format and entities may not be ordered

6. Word-tag .tsv
   This is Stanford lib basic data format. To train new CRF Model all other data formats will be transformed to this format inside service.

- each line contains \t separated word and label
- untagged marked by tag "O"
- punctuation signs , ; . as a separate words
- each phrase ended with dot .
- empty line between phrases

## Examples of query and mutation

### NORMALIZE query

- Normalization of tagged phrases means to convert them to standard format - { text xtext entities {tag token span offset tokens start end} }
- Tagged phrases could be represented in different formats (see examples and comments below in query code)
- To avoid ambiguity use xml-tagged text or character based entity format - {tag, token, offset, span}.
- Words based data format - {tokens, start, end, color} is developed to use in Active Learning UI and is not precise format because entity sometime is the part of word but not separate word.

```python
query Normalize {
  normalize(

      {

        text: "Co-inventor of calculus, a major contributor to the science of optics and a gifted mathematician, Isaac Newton (1643-1727), who was born in Lincolnshire, outlined the laws of mechanics that now underpin vast swaths of classical physics."

### TRAINING-TO-KIND mutation

There are several differences between mutation - 'trainingToKind' and query - 'training':

1. mutation adds binary .ser.gz-file as a Kind to Maana with CRF Model content
2. mutation makes a record into the 'NERModelStat' Kind in Maana (if Kind doesn't exist it wiill be created)
3. mutation makes a record into the 'NERLabeledData' Kind in Maana (if Kind doesn't exist it wiill be created)

- data.URL is a path or URL to data file of many formats: .json, .csv, .tsv, .txt (see explanation below)

### GET-MODEL query

Return Model in format - encoded Base64 String
Parameter 'length':

1.  if omitted or 0 or >= model size then return whole Model
2.  otherwise - return first portion of bytes, next query return next portion, etc. until return 0 which means end of model

```python
query SplitToSentences {

    text: "Saint Petersburg (Russian: Санкт-Петербу́рг) is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with 5 million inhabitants in 2012, part of the Saint Petersburg agglomeration with a population of 6.2 million (2015). An important Russian port on the Baltic Sea, it has a status of a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on 27 May [O.S. 16 May] 1703. On 1 September 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd (Russian: Петрогра́д), on 26 January 1924 to Leningrad (Russian: Ленингра́д), and on 1 October 1991 back to its original name. During the periods 1713–1728 and 1732–1918, Saint Petersburg was the capital of Imperial Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow, which is about 625 km (388 miles) to the south-east. Saint Petersburg is one of the most modern cities of Russia, as well as its cultural capital. The Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Saint Petersburg is home to the Hermitage, one of the largest art museums in the world. Many foreign consulates, international corporations, banks and businesses have offices in Saint Petersburg."

### EXTEND-XML-LABELING query

Extending XML-tagged entities throughout the whole text.

- If we labeled small part of text and want to extend labeling throughout the whole text, we can use extendXMLText() or extend() functions.
- Service will build new CRF Model on labeled sentences only and applies this model to whole text to detect other entities.
- After that we can make correction of detected entities and repeat process again.
- So, service works as auto-annotation system to spead up of training datasets preparation process.

### EXTEND-LABELING query

Extending tagged entities throughout the whole text (see comments for extendXMLText() above).

- This function not only extend labeling but return probabilities {prob} of entity detection. It allows us to pay more attention and correct entities with low probability first.
- Moreover it calculate probabilities of k best annotations related to whole text.
- If we see that difference between first and second k-best probabilities is big enough it good sign of model verification.
- calcProb : calculation of probability distribution vector for each detected entity
- k : if > 0, return probabilities of k best annotations (related to whole text)

### EXTEND-BATCH-LABELING query

Unlike extend() query if we have input data as a set of texts use extendBatch().

- Before applying extendBatch() take advantage of splitToSentences() query.
- See also comments for extendXMLText() and extend() above.
